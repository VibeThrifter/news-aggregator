## Epic 3 Status (LLM Insights Pipeline)

**Current State:** ✅ **All components implemented and wired up**

### What's Working ✅
- ✅ **Story 3.1**: Prompt builder with templates for timeline, viewpoints, fallacies
- ✅ **Story 3.2**: LLM client (Mistral), insight service, repository layer, admin trigger endpoint
- ✅ **Story 3.3**: CSV export service with API routes registered
- ✅ **Configuration**: Mistral API key configured in `.env`
- ✅ **API Endpoints**:
  - `POST /admin/trigger/generate-insights/{event_id}` - Generate insights for an event
  - `GET /api/v1/exports/events` - Export all events to CSV
  - `GET /api/v1/exports/events/{event_id}` - Export single event details to CSV

### Known Issue ⚠️
**LLM Schema Validation**: Mistral API sometimes returns spectrum values (e.g., "center-right") that don't match the expected Dutch enum values ("mainstream", "links", "rechts", "alternatief", "overheid", "sociale_media"). This causes validation errors during insight generation.

**Impact**: Insight generation endpoint may fail with "JSON-respons kon niet worden gevalideerd" error.

**Potential Solutions** (to be addressed in future epic):
1. Update prompt template to be more explicit about allowed spectrum values
2. Add fallback/normalization logic in the LLM client to map common English values to Dutch equivalents
3. Consider making spectrum enum more flexible or using a different validation approach

**Epic ID:** Epic 0 – Provisioning & Ops Setup
**Title:** Implement Configuration Loader and Structured Logging Foundation
**Objective:** Provide reusable configuration and logging utilities that load environment variables, validate them, and emit structured logs used across the backend services.
**Background/Context:**
- Source: docs/PRD.md (Epic 0 – Story 0.3).
- Reference: docs/architecture.md (Project Structure – `backend/app/core/config.py`, `backend/app/core/logging.py`; Patterns and Standards – Error Handling Strategy; Technology Table – structlog, Pydantic).
- Target Paths: `backend/app/core/config.py`, `backend/app/core/logging.py`, `backend/app/core/__init__.py`, `backend/tests/unit/test_config.py`, `backend/tests/unit/test_logging.py`.
**Acceptance Criteria (AC):**
- Given a populated `.env` when `Settings()` from `backend.app.core.config` is instantiated, then all required fields (RSS URLs, scheduler interval, database URL, embedding model, LLM settings) are validated with correct types and defaults.
- Given a missing required variable when `Settings()` loads, then a `ValidationError` is raised and the logger records a clear error per the Architecture.md Error Handling Strategy.
- Given `structlog` configured when `logger.bind(correlation_id=...)` is used in any module, then log output includes JSON-formatted records with shared context (timestamp, level, name, correlation_id).
**Subtask Checklist:**
- [x] Implement `Settings` class in `backend/app/core/config.py` using `pydantic_settings.BaseSettings` pulling values from environment with defaults where appropriate (e.g., `DATABASE_URL=sqlite+aiosqlite:///./data/db.sqlite`).

  - Ready for Story 1.1 (RSS Feed Plugin Framework)

---
**Story ID:** 1.1
**Epic ID:** Epic 1 – Ingest & Preprocessing Backbone
**Title:** Implement RSS Feed Plugin Framework with NOS & NU.nl Readers
**Objective:** Create a pluggable feed reader layer that polls NOS and NU.nl RSS feeds, normalizes entries, and exposes them to the ingest pipeline.
**Background/Context:**
- Source: docs/PRD.md (Epic 1 – Story 1.1).
- Reference: docs/architecture.md (Project Structure – `backend/app/feeds`; Component View – Feed Reader Plugins; Technology Table – feedparser; Patterns and Standards – Strategy Pattern for feed readers).
- Target Paths: `backend/app/feeds/base.py`, `backend/app/feeds/nos.py`, `backend/app/feeds/nunl.py`, `backend/app/services/ingest_service.py` (registration), `backend/tests/unit/test_feeds.py`, fixtures under `backend/tests/fixtures/rss/`.
**Acceptance Criteria (AC):**
- Given a registered feed reader when APScheduler triggers `poll_feeds`, then each active reader fetches entries and returns normalized `FeedItem` objects with source metadata and ISO timestamps.
- Given the NOS and NU.nl feeds when the reader encounters duplicate `guid` or URLs, then duplicates are filtered before returning.
- Given a network or parsing failure when fetching a feed, then the reader logs the error with context and retries once using exponential backoff without crashing the scheduler job.
**Subtask Checklist:**
- [x] Define an abstract `FeedReader` base class in `backend/app/feeds/base.py` with methods `id`, `source_metadata`, and `fetch()`.
- [x] Implement `NosRssReader` and `NuRssReader` using `feedparser` with HTTPX fallback, normalizing to a shared dataclass or Pydantic model.
- [x] Register available readers in `backend/app/services/ingest_service.py` and expose a `poll_feeds()` orchestration method.
- [x] Add retry logic (e.g., `tenacity`) per Architecture.md Error Handling Strategy.
- [x] Create sample RSS fixtures in `backend/tests/fixtures/rss/` and unit tests covering parsing, dedupe, error logging.
- [x] Update scheduler stub in `backend/app/core/scheduler.py` to call `poll_feeds()`.
- [x] Run unit tests `pytest backend/tests/unit/test_feeds.py`.
**Testing Requirements:**
- Unit Tests via `pytest` (mock HTTP requests, use fixtures).
- Definition of Done: ACs met, tests passing, logging verified via assertions.

  - Ready for Story 1.2 (Article Fetching, Extraction, and Normalization Pipeline)

---
**Story ID:** 1.2.1
**Epic ID:** Epic 1 – Ingest & Preprocessing Backbone
**Title:** Implement Source-Aware Article Fetch Pipeline with Consent Handling
**Objective:** Ensure full article content can be retrieved from privacy-gated or paywalled sources by adding configurable consent handling, cookie persistence, and parser fallbacks.
**Background/Context:**
- Source: docs/PRD.md (Epic 1 – Ingest pipeline needs full-text for clustering/LLM).
- Reference: docs/architecture.md (Ingestion layer; Source Profiles & Consent Handling).
- Target Paths: `backend/app/ingestion/fetcher.py`, `backend/app/ingestion/__init__.py`, `backend/app/services/ingest_service.py`, new `backend/app/config/source_profiles.py`, docs updates (architecture, README).
**Acceptance Criteria (AC):**
- Given sources requiring privacy consent (e.g., NU.nl), when the fetcher runs, it performs the configured consent/cookie negotiation and retrieves the full article content.
- Given a source marked as `requires_js: true`, then the fetcher falls back to the configured dynamic renderer (stub/strategy).
- Given a source-specific profile, when the profile changes (e.g., new consent endpoint), then updating the profile file is sufficient without code changes.
- Given cookies acquired during consent, they are persisted and reused until expiry to minimize manual steps.
- Given a fetch failure after all strategies, the pipeline records a structured failure event and continues processing other articles.
**Subtask Checklist:**
- [x] Design `source_profiles.yaml` describing feed URL, fetch strategy, consent endpoints, parser preference, retries per source.
- [x] Implement loader (`backend/app/config/source_profiles.py`) that validates YAML against a schema (Pydantic).
- [x] Extend `fetch_article_html` to accept a `SourceProfile` and execute strategies: simple fetch, consent flow, cookie persistence, dynamic fallback hook.
- [x] Persist consent cookies in `data/cookies/<source>.json` with expiry; auto-renew when expired.
- [x] Update `IngestService` to pass the appropriate profile when fetching each article.
- [x] Add fallback parser options (Trafilatura default; BeautifulSoup/Readability as configured).
- [x] Extend integration tests with mocked consent flows (e.g., federation of responses).
- [x] Update docs (architecture Project Structure, ingestion description, README quickstart) with instructions for adding new sources/profiles.
- [x] MANUAL STEP: Document instructions for handmatig toevoegen van consent cookies (README update met stappen om browsercookies te exporteren en in `data/cookies/<source>.json` te plaatsen).
**Testing Requirements:**
- Integration tests with mocked HTTP responses verifying consent flow, cookie persistence, and fallback parsing.
- Unit tests for profile loader validation.
- Definition of Done: ACs met, tests green, documentation updated.

**Story ID:** 1.2
**Epic ID:** Epic 1 – Ingest & Preprocessing Backbone
**Title:** Build Article Fetching, Extraction, and Normalization Pipeline
**Objective:** Download article HTML, extract readable text, deduplicate by URL, and persist normalized article records in the database.
**Background/Context:**
- Source: docs/PRD.md (Epic 1 – Story 1.2).
- Reference: docs/architecture.md (Project Structure – `backend/app/ingestion`, `backend/app/repositories/article_repo.py`; Data Model – `articles` table).
- Target Paths: `backend/app/ingestion/fetcher.py`, `backend/app/ingestion/parser.py`, `backend/app/services/ingest_service.py`, `backend/app/repositories/article_repo.py`, `backend/tests/integration/test_article_ingestion.py`, fixture HTML under `backend/tests/fixtures/html/`.
**Acceptance Criteria (AC):**
- Given a new feed item when the ingest service fetches its URL, then the normalized article stored in the database includes clean text (no HTML tags), summary/snippet, publication timestamp, and source metadata.
- Given a duplicate URL already stored when the ingest pipeline executes, then the repository skips insertion and logs a dedupe notice without raising an exception.
- Given an article fetch that fails (timeout, 404), then the pipeline records the failure in logs and returns a recoverable error that does not halt other items.
**Subtask Checklist:**
- [x] Implement `fetch_article_html` in `backend/app/ingestion/fetcher.py` using async HTTPX with timeout and retries, respecting Architecture.md Error Handling Strategy.
- [x] Implement `parse_article_html` in `backend/app/ingestion/parser.py` using Trafilatura, returning normalized text and summary.
- [x] Extend `article_repo.py` with `upsert_from_feed_item` that enforces URL uniqueness and stores metadata/summary/content.
- [x] Orchestrate ingest in `services/ingest_service.py` to fetch → parse → persist, integrating with Story 1.1 output.
- [x] Create integration test `backend/tests/integration/test_article_ingestion.py` using temporary SQLite database (via fixtures) and sample HTML to verify dedupe and error handling.
- [x] Update logging to include `correlation_id` from scheduler context.
- [x] Run `PYTHONPATH=. .venv/bin/pytest backend/tests/integration/test_article_ingestion.py`.
**Testing Requirements:**

**Title:** Implement NLP Enrichment Pipeline (Normalization, Embeddings, TF-IDF, NER)
**Objective:** Transform stored articles into enriched records with normalized text, sentence embeddings, TF-IDF vectors, and named entities ready for event detection.
**Background/Context:**
- Source: docs/PRD.md (Epic 1 – Story 1.3).
- Reference: docs/architecture.md (Project Structure – `backend/app/nlp`; Technology Table – sentence-transformers, spaCy, scikit-learn; Data Model – `articles` enrichment columns).
- Target Paths: `backend/app/nlp/preprocess.py`, `backend/app/nlp/embeddings.py`, `backend/app/nlp/tfidf.py`, `backend/app/nlp/ner.py`, `backend/app/services/enrich_service.py`, `backend/tests/unit/test_preprocess.py`, `backend/tests/unit/test_embeddings.py`, `backend/tests/integration/test_enrichment_pipeline.py`, data cache folder `data/models/`.
**Acceptance Criteria (AC):**
- Given a stored article when the enrichment service runs, then the article row is updated with normalized tokens, embedding vector (serialized), TF-IDF vector, and extracted entities as JSON.
- Given repeated enrichment runs when the TF-IDF model has been persisted, then it reuses the cached vectorizer to avoid recomputation and completes within the target <1s per article.
- Given the spaCy model missing during initialization, then enrichment aborts with a descriptive error prompting the manual download step (Story 0.1 manual instructions).
**Subtask Checklist:**
- [x] Implement text normalization utilities (lowercase, stopword removal, lemmatization hooks) in `preprocess.py`.
- [x] Wrap sentence-transformers model loading with lazy singleton in `embeddings.py`, allowing model name override from settings.
- [x] Build TF-IDF vectorizer module with joblib persistence to `data/models/tfidf.pkl` and helper to update vocabulary incrementally.
- [x] Implement spaCy NER wrapper in `ner.py` using `nl_core_news_lg`, returning entities with type labels.
- [x] Create `enrich_service.py` orchestrating the sequence (load article → preprocess → embed → tfidf → NER → persist via repository layer).
- [x] Add unit tests for preprocessing normalization and embedding output shape (mock actual model).
- [x] Add integration test using in-memory SQLite verifying article enrichment end-to-end.
- [x] Update Makefile to include `source .venv/bin/activate && python -m spacy download nl_core_news_lg` in setup docs reference.
- MANUAL STEP: Ensure the spaCy model `nl_core_news_lg` is downloaded (`source .venv/bin/activate && python -m spacy download nl_core_news_lg`).
**Testing Requirements:**
- Unit & Integration Tests via `pytest` (mock heavy models where possible to keep runtime acceptable; maintain coverage target).
- Definition of Done: ACs met, tests passing, persisted vectorizer verified.

- Source: docs/PRD.md (Epic 2 – Story 2.1).
- Reference: docs/architecture.md (Project Structure – `backend/app/services/vector_index.py`; Data Models – events centroids; context-events.md algorithm: Event Candidate Search).
- Target Paths: `backend/app/services/vector_index.py`, `backend/app/events/__init__.py`, `backend/tests/unit/test_vector_index.py`, storage path `data/vector_index.bin`.
**Acceptance Criteria (AC):**
- Given existing events with centroid embeddings when the index service builds the index, then it persists `vector_index.bin` (with metadata) and supports reload on process restart.
- Given a new article embedding and timestamp when `query_candidates` is invoked, then it returns up to top-k event IDs filtered to those active within the configured time window (default 7 days).
- Given the index has no entries or the query timestamp is older than the retention window, then the service returns an empty list without raising errors.
**Subtask Checklist:**
- [x] Implement `VectorIndexService` encapsulating hnswlib index management (build, upsert, delete, query) with settings from `config.py`.
- [x] Store index metadata (dimension, ef, m) in adjacent JSON to support validation on load.
