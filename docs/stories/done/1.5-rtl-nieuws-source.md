# Story 1.5: Add RTL Nieuws as News Source

**Story ID:** 1.5
**Epic ID:** Epic 1 – RSS Ingestion & NLP Enrichment
**Status:** Active

## Objective

Add RTL Nieuws as a fourth news source to increase content diversity and enable cross-source event clustering with commercial broadcaster perspective.

## Background/Context

- **Source:** RTL Nieuws is one of the largest commercial news broadcasters in the Netherlands
- **RSS Feed:** `https://www.rtl.nl/rss.xml` - Valid RSS feed with recent articles
- **Fetch Strategy:** Simple HTTP fetch expected to work (no heavy JavaScript rendering like AD.nl)
- **Value:** Adds commercial broadcaster perspective alongside NOS (public), NU.nl (DPG), and AD.nl (DPG)
- **Reference:** `source_profiles.yaml`, `backend/app/ingestion/` module

### RSS Feed Analysis

```
Feed URL: https://www.rtl.nl/rss.xml
Content-Type: application/rss+xml
Sample articles: News, sports, entertainment, lifestyle
```

## Acceptance Criteria (AC)

- [ ] Given the RTL Nieuws RSS feed URL when the scheduler polls, then new articles are discovered and stored in the database.
- [ ] Given an RTL Nieuws article URL when fetched, then full article text is extracted using trafilatura (>500 chars typical).
- [ ] Given RTL Nieuws articles in the database when event clustering runs, then they are clustered with articles from other sources on the same topic.
- [ ] Given existing NOS/NU.nl/AD.nl sources when RTL is added, then they continue working without regression.
- [ ] Given the source profile configuration when ingestion runs, then RTL articles are correctly attributed to `rtl_rss` source.

## Subtask Checklist

### Configuration
- [ ] Add `rtl_rss` source profile to `source_profiles.yaml`
- [ ] Configure appropriate fetch strategy (test if `simple` works, otherwise try `consent_cookie`)
- [ ] Set appropriate user agent header

### Testing & Validation
- [ ] Test RSS feed parsing with existing feed reader
- [ ] Test article fetch with httpx (verify no JavaScript rendering needed)
- [ ] Test trafilatura parsing extracts article content correctly
- [ ] Run manual ingestion to verify articles are stored
- [ ] Verify articles cluster with same-topic articles from other sources

### Integration
- [ ] Update any source-specific documentation if needed
- [ ] Verify scheduler picks up new source automatically

## Testing Requirements

- **Manual test:** Fetch sample RTL article URL, verify content extraction
- **Integration test:** Run ingestion cycle, verify RTL articles in database
- **Clustering test:** Verify RTL articles cluster with NOS/NU.nl on same news events
- **Definition of Done:** RTL articles successfully ingested and clustered

## Technical Notes

- Start with `fetch_strategy: simple` - RTL likely serves content without heavy JS
- If consent dialog appears, may need `consent_cookie` strategy similar to NU.nl
- Monitor for any bot detection or rate limiting
- RTL uses standard article structure, trafilatura should parse well

## Dependencies

- Story 1.4 (Playwright scraping) - complete (fallback if needed)
- Existing RSS ingestion pipeline - operational
